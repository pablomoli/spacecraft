I'm working on a React/Next.js spacecraft portfolio website with a wormhole animation feature. The project is on branch feature/wormhole-animation.

Current Implementation:
• Galaxy component (using OGL/WebGL) replaces StarField as background
• Earth component with independent rotation (0.0002 for Earth, 0.0004 for clouds)
• Camera orbits Earth during normal scroll, turns away during extra scroll section
• Extra 100vh section after contact for triggering wormhole
• Wormhole animation should trigger when scrolling to 100% of extra section

The Problem: The extra scroll section is detected but the scroll progress stays at 0%. When entering the extra section:
• scrollTop: 9790
• normalSectionsHeight: 9790
• extraSectionHeight: 979
• Total scrollHeight: 10769

The extra section exists but extraProgress calculation (scrollTop - extraSectionStart) / extraSectionHeight stays at 0/979 = 0%.

Key Files:
• /src/components/Overlay.js - Contains scroll handling logic
• /src/app/page.js - Main component with Galaxy animation state
• /src/components/Scene.js - Camera movement logic
• /src/hooks/useScroll.js - Scroll state management

What Should Happen:
1. User scrolls through normal sections (0-100%)
2. After contact section, enters extra 100vh section
3. Camera turns 90° right as user scrolls through extra section
4. At 80% of extra section, Galaxy starts "charging" effect
5. At 100% of extra section, 3-second wormhole animation triggers
6. After animation, user returns to hero section

Console Output Shows:
• Normal scroll progress works (0% to 91%)
• "Entered extra section!" logs correctly
• But extra section progress remains at 0%
• Galaxy component mounts/unmounts twice (WebGL context lost)

Please help me fix the extra scroll progress calculation so the wormhole animation can trigger.

Additional Context:
- We're using Lenis for smooth scrolling
- The body has overflow: hidden and position: fixed
- The actual scrollable container is a div with class "scroll"
- Trackpad scrolling might not be working due to Lenis configuration issues
